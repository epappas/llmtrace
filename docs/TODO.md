## Acceptance Criteria (Literature-Anchored)
These criteria define when a task can be marked ✅. If any criterion is not met, status must remain 🔄 or ⬜.

Input Security (IS): Must implement the specific algorithmic behaviors described in the literature, not heuristic approximations. For IS-001–IS-003, MOF requires token-wise bias detection, debiasing data generation, and retraining with reported over-defense gains in `docs/research/injecguard-over-defense-mitigation.md`. For IS-006/IS-007, thresholds must be calibrated at 0.1/0.5/1% FPR with TPR reporting per `docs/research/security-state-of-art-2026.md`. For IS-010/IS-011, WordNet-style synonym expansion and true lemmatization are required, not regex-only stems, per `docs/research/dmpi-pmhfe-prompt-injection-detection.md`. For IS-024–IS-029, adversarial robustness must include attack-specific defenses and calibration beyond normalization per `docs/research/bypassing-llm-guardrails-evasion.md`.

DMPI-PMHFE Architecture (DMPI-001–DMPI-006): The fusion pipeline matches the paper's dual-channel design. All 6 deviations resolved: average pooling (DMPI-001), 2 FC layers (DMPI-002), 10 binary heuristic features with paper keyword sets (DMPI-003, DMPI-005), repetition threshold >=3 (DMPI-004), `is_*` naming convention (DMPI-006). See Loop 12a and `docs/research/dmpi-pmhfe-prompt-injection-detection.md` for full specification. ML-001 (fusion training) is no longer blocked by DMPI deviations.

Tool/Agent Security (AS): Tool boundary defenses must parse/sanitize with LLM-based extraction and CheckTool-style triggering detection, not heuristic filters, per `docs/research/defense-tool-result-parsing.md` and `docs/research/indirect-injection-firewalls.md`. Multi-agent defense requires an explicit coordinator + guard multi-pass architecture (and second opinion path) rather than a single-pass heuristic pipeline, per `docs/research/multi-agent-defense-pipeline.md`. Pattern enforcement must detect plan compliance and routing by trust level as defined in `docs/research/design-patterns-securing-agents.md`.

Output Security (OS): HaluGate-style token-level detection requires ModernBERT token classification and NLI explanation layer, not heuristic or sentence-only checks, per `docs/research/security-state-of-art-2026.md`. Streaming safety must use partial-sequence models and progressive confidence (SCM), not re-running full-text detectors, per `docs/research/security-state-of-art-2026.md`. CodeShield parity requires Semgrep integration and coverage beyond basic static rules, per `docs/research/security-state-of-art-2026.md`.

Privacy/Protocol/Multimodal (PR/AS/MM/SA): Membership inference, poisoning, MINJA, and protocol exploit defenses must match the threat models in `docs/research/prompt-injections-to-protocol-exploits.md`. Multimodal defenses must include OCR and modality-specific detectors as described in the same literature. Policy language and taint/blast-radius controls must align with `docs/research/llmtrace-defense-pipeline-design.md`.

Evaluation (EV): Benchmarks must implement the named suites with published dataset sizes and result formatting per `docs/research/benchmarks-and-tools-landscape.md` and `docs/research/wasp-web-agent-security-benchmark.md`.

Non-Functional Requirements (NFR): Security-critical detections must be deterministic and testable, with clear latency budgets where specified (e.g., HaluGate sentinel 12ms class, token-level detection 76–162ms) from `docs/research/security-state-of-art-2026.md`. Any ML integration must include reproducible model loading, configuration, and tests demonstrating expected metrics.

> Reference: `docs/research/dmpi-pmhfe-prompt-injection-detection.md`

| ID | Feature | Complexity | Status |
|----|---------|-----------|--------|
| DMPI-001 | **Average pooling instead of CLS token** — Implemented `masked_mean_pool()` in `ml_detector.rs`. Added `PoolingStrategy` enum (Cls/MeanPool), defaulting to MeanPool. BERT and DeBERTa paths both use attention-mask-aware average pooling over all non-padding tokens, matching paper spec. `DebertaV2ContextPooler` is now optional (only loaded for Cls strategy). Architecture doc: `docs/architecture/DMPI_001_AVERAGE_POOLING.md`. | Medium | :white_check_mark: |
| DMPI-002 | **2 FC layers instead of 3** — Removed `HIDDEN_2` and `fc3`; collapsed to `fc1(783->256)->ReLU->fc2(256->2)->SoftMax` matching paper spec. Input dim changes from 783 to 778 once DMPI-003 is also applied (768 + 10 = 778). Architecture doc: `docs/architecture/DMPI_002_TWO_FC_LAYERS.md`. | Medium | :white_check_mark: |
| DMPI-003 | **10 binary features instead of 15 mixed** — Replaced 15-dim vector (8 binary + 7 numeric) with 10 binary features matching paper Appendix A. Removed all numeric features. Added keyword-based detection for `is_ignore`, `is_format_manipulation`, `is_immoral`. Reordered to paper spec. Architecture doc: `docs/architecture/DMPI_003_TEN_BINARY_FEATURES.md`. | High | :white_check_mark: |
| DMPI-004 | **Repetition threshold >=3 instead of >10** — Named constant `REPETITION_THRESHOLD = 3`. Word-level and phrase-level conditions changed to `>= REPETITION_THRESHOLD`. Expanded `COMMON_WORDS` (+37 words) and added `COMMON_PHRASES` exclusion list (29 common English bigrams) to control false positives at the lower threshold. | Low | :white_check_mark: |
| DMPI-005 | **Missing paper features: is_immoral, is_ignore, is_format_manipulation** — All 3 missing features now implemented as keyword-in-text checks in `feature_extraction.rs`. `is_ignore` (index 0): ignore, reveal, disregard, forget, overlook, regardless. `is_format_manipulation` (index 4): encode, disguising, morse, binary, hexadecimal. `is_immoral` (index 7): hitting, amoral, immoral, deceit, irresponsible, offensive, violent, unethical, smack, fake, illegal, biased. Resolved as part of DMPI-003. Architecture doc: `docs/architecture/DMPI_003_TEN_BINARY_FEATURES.md`. | Medium | :white_check_mark: |
| DMPI-006 | **Feature naming alignment to paper convention** — All 8 finding types renamed to paper's `is_*` convention: `flattery_attack->is_incentive`, `urgency_attack->is_urgent`, `roleplay_attack->is_hypothetical`, `impersonation_attack->is_systemic`, `covert_attack->is_covert`, `excuse_attack->is_immoral`, `many_shot_attack->is_shot_attack`, `repetition_attack->is_repeated_token`.

### Loop 23 — E2E Accuracy Optimization (Post Stress Test)
> After wiring OperatingPoint, threshold filtering, over-defence suppression, and score capping for single-detector findings, the E2E stress test reached **83.7% accuracy, 84.7% F1** on a 153-sample corpus (79 malicious, 74 benign) from 13+ benchmark datasets. The remaining 15 FPs and 10 FNs require ML-level fixes documented below.
> Reference: `docs/FEATURE_ROADMAP.md` section 3.4.4 for full analysis.
>
> **Review findings (2026-02-15, AI Engineer + MLOps Engineer):**
> - Combined ML-030 + ML-033 impact is NOT additive; realistic combined: -7 to -12 FPs.
> - ML-030 must precede ML-033 (calibrating before fine-tuning is wasted work).
> - ML-030 triggers ML-001 re-evaluation (fusion classifier needs re-validation after base model changes).
> - ML-033 supersedes IS-029 (Loop 22). IS-029 remains for temperature scaling only; ML-033 adds proper Platt scaling.
> - IS-060 elevated to P0 (4 FNs, largest single FN category, indirect injection is most dangerous for agent systems).
> - IS-070 elevated to P1 (shell injection in agent contexts is high-severity).
> - ML-034 elevated to P1 (encoding bypass is an active evasion vector).
> - Acceptance criterion for ALL items: full benchmark suite recall must not decrease by >1pp.
> - MLOps prerequisites (OPS-001 through OPS-008) must be addressed before deploying model changes.
> - Recommended execution order: ML-032 + ML-034 (patch evasion vectors) -> ML-033 (calibrate existing system) -> IS-070 (expand detection) -> ML-030 (model fine-tuning, highest risk last).

**Infrastructure already wired (this session):**
- `SecurityAnalysisConfig.operating_point` + `SecurityAnalysisConfig.over_defence` config fields
- `EnsembleSecurityAnalyzer::filter_by_thresholds()` applying per-category confidence gates
- `EnsembleSecurityAnalyzer::apply_over_defence()` suppressing auxiliary-only findings (no injection corroboration)
- Single-detector score cap at 60 (Medium) in `add_security_finding()`
- 3 new regex patterns: `roleplay_lets` (jailbreak), `authority_claim_update` (is_systemic), `disable_safety` (prompt_injection)

    v
ML-032 + ML-034 (patch evasion vectors, low risk)

```

**MLOps prerequisites (must complete before deploying ML changes):**

| ID | Feature | Complexity | Status |
|----|---------|-----------|--------|
| OPS-001 | **Externalize SecurityConfig to file/env** — All thresholds, operating points, and model identifiers loadable from config file or environment variables. Hardcoded values serve only as fallback defaults. Required before ML-033 (recalibrated thresholds currently require code change and rebuild). | Medium | ⬜ |
| OPS-002 | **Pin model revisions with SHA** — Use `hf_hub` revision/commit SHA parameters for all model downloads. Add SHA256 integrity verification of SafeTensors files. Current code downloads latest revision on cold start, risking silent behavior changes. | Low | ⬜ |
| OPS-003 | **Model inference metrics** — Expose per-model inference latency histograms, raw score distributions, classification outcome counters, ensemble agreement rate. Essential for validating model changes in production. | Medium | ⬜ |
| OPS-004 | **Model version manifest** — `models.toml` declaring model name, revision SHA, expected SafeTensors SHA256, deployment timestamp. Enables rollback by reverting manifest to previous version. | Low | ⬜ |
| OPS-005 | **CI regression test gate** — CI step that loads ensemble, runs fixed regression set (50-100 canonical examples), asserts no accuracy regression beyond threshold. Blocks merge on failure. | Medium | ⬜ |
| OPS-006 | **Training infrastructure for ML-030** — Define training environment (Python/PyTorch), GPU provisioning, SafeTensors export validation step ensuring layer-name compatibility with Candle loader. Define artifact registry for fine-tuned weights. | High | ⬜ |
| OPS-007 | **Expand calibration dataset to 1,000+ samples** — 153 stress test samples is insufficient for Platt scaling. Collect stratified samples across injection types. Separate calibration holdout from ML-030 training set (at least 30% of NotInject reserved for calibration). | Medium | ⬜ |
| OPS-008 | **Shadow-mode inference** — Run new model ensemble in parallel without affecting response path, log predictions for offline comparison. Required for safe validation of ML-030 fine-tuned model before production cutover. | High | ⬜ |

**ML accuracy work items:**

| ID | Feature | Complexity | Priority | Status |
|----|---------|-----------|----------|--------|
| ML-032 | **Short-input confidence scaling** — For inputs < 10 tokens, scale confidence threshold linearly from 0.95 (at 1 token) to normal threshold (at 10 tokens). Do NOT bypass ML entirely to avoid blind spots for short attacks like "Ignore all previous instructions" (5 tokens). Estimated impact: -1 FP. | Low | P1 | ⬜ |
| ML-034 | **Encoding decoder preprocessor** — Before ML inference, apply decoding pipeline: base64, rot13, leetspeak, hex, binary, upside-down text, Cyrillic homoglyphs. Add content-type heuristic before decoding (skip base64 if string contains spaces/punctuation). Specify latency cap (5ms max). Must define integration plan with existing `jailbreak_detector.rs` encoding detection (augment, not replace). 7/11 encoding evasion test cases detected (64%); 4 misses are encoded payloads without plaintext injection markers. | Medium | P1 | ⬜ |
| ML-033 | **Confidence recalibration (Platt scaling)** — Apply Platt scaling (logistic regression) to recalibrate DeBERTa output probabilities. Supersedes IS-029 temperature scaling. Requires OPS-007 (1,000+ calibration samples). Calibration set MUST be disjoint from ML-030 training set. Specify per-model vs post-ensemble calibration. Re-derive operating point thresholds after calibration (current HighRecall/Balanced/HighPrecision values become invalid). Estimated impact: -2 to -4 FPs. Depends on: OPS-007. | Medium | P1 | ⬜ |
| IS-060 | **Spotlighting/datamarking for indirect injection** — Split input into instruction zones and data zones using configurable boundary markers. Apply injection detection only to data zones. Sub-tasks: (a) zone boundary detection heuristics for common data formats (HTML tables, email headers, CSV, JSON data fields), (b) config-declared boundary support, (c) ensemble integration (feed datamarking results into existing voting). Targets 4 BIPIA FNs (40% of all FNs). Reference: `docs/research/spotlighting-indirect-injection-defense.md` (datamarking reduces ASR from >50% to <3%). | High | P0 | ⬜ |
| IS-070 | **Shell command injection detection** — Detect dangerous shell commands (curl with exfiltration, python -c with socket, wget, reverse shell, rm -rf) in prompt content. Extend existing RL3-02 regex patterns (do not duplicate). Distinct from prompt injection; targets 2 FN code execution attacks. Critical for agent systems with tool-use capabilities. | Medium | P1 | ⬜ |
| ML-030 | **DeBERTa fine-tuning on NotInject dataset** — Fine-tune `protectai/deberta-v3-base-prompt-injection-v2` using 339 NotInject samples + 15 stress test FPs + 10-20 "creative writing instruction" samples as hard negatives. Mix with full training set (61k benign + 16k injection from ML-014) to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Training: 3 epochs, lr=2e-5, batch_size=16. Reserve 20% of NotInject for validation. Acceptance criteria: F1 >= 0.88 on held-out set, no per-class recall regression > 2%, full benchmark suite pass. Estimated impact: -5 to -10 FPs. Depends on: OPS-002, OPS-004, OPS-005, OPS-006. Triggers: ML-001 re-evaluation. | High | P0 | ⬜ |
| ML-031 | **Multilingual calibration** — Two sub-tasks: (a) add language detection to ensemble pipeline (e.g., `lingua-rs` or trigram detector), (b) calibrate per-language confidence thresholds using holdout set. Collect 1,000+ benign Chinese samples (traditional + simplified, technical/conversational/educational). Fine-tuning is a separate future item. Estimated impact: -2 FPs. Depends on: ML-030. | Medium | P2 | ⬜ |

## Notes

- IS-007 (Configurable operating points) completed in R8 commit `41e219b`. Fully wired to proxy config and ensemble in 2026-02-15 session: `SecurityAnalysisConfig.operating_point` field drives `EnsembleSecurityAnalyzer::with_operating_point()`, `filter_by_thresholds()` applies per-category confidence gates, `over_defence` flag enables auxiliary-only suppression.
- R11 (code_security module) completed in commit `b08dccc`, tests fixed in `aa9ab98`
- Each loop targets a coherent feature set that can be tested independently
- Phase 1 focuses on closing critical 100% ASR gaps and establishing evaluation baseline
- RALPH quality policy: no placeholders/mocks; if spec requires ML, implement real ML inference (regex fallback only when model weights unavailable).
- AS-004/AS-006/AS-007 are 🔄 because literature expects LLM-based parsing/sanitization for tool outputs; current implementation is heuristic only.
- AS-020/AS-021/AS-023/AS-024 are 🔄 because literature expects multi-agent LLM coordination; current implementation is heuristic/policy-only.
- IS-024/IS-027/IS-028/IS-029 are 🔄 because only normalization/temperature scaling exists (no attack-specific defenses or Platt scaling). ML-033 (Loop 23) supersedes IS-029 for Platt scaling; IS-029 remains for temperature-scaling-only scope.
- PR-006 is 🔄 because full non-Latin PII coverage and a custom-entity plugin architecture are not fully implemented.
- Tool parsing expectations come from `docs/research/defense-tool-result-parsing.md` and `docs/research/indirect-injection-firewalls.md`.
- Multi-agent expectations come from `docs/research/multi-agent-defense-pipeline.md`.
- Adversarial robustness expectations come from `docs/research/bypassing-llm-guardrails-evasion.md`.
- Over-defense mitigation expectations come from `docs/research/injecguard-over-defense-mitigation.md`.
- Benchmark coverage expectations come from `docs/research/benchmarks-and-tools-landscape.md` and `docs/research/wasp-web-agent-security-benchmark.md`.
- CyberSecEval 2 benchmark expectations (EV-006) come from `docs/research/cyberseceval2-llm-security-benchmark.md`. The 251 attack sample count is sourced from DMPI-PMHFE (arXiv 2506.06384) which used the CyberSecEval 2 prompt injection dataset; the full paper covers additional suites (500 code interpreter abuse prompts, exploit generation, FRR).
- BIPIA benchmark expectations (EV-014) come from `docs/research/bipia-indirect-prompt-injection-benchmark.md`. First indirect prompt injection benchmark (KDD 2025, arXiv 2312.14197): 86,250 test prompts, 50 attack types, 25-model baseline. Boundary token defense (`<data>`/`</data>`) is most impactful intervention (1064% ASR increase without it) and is implementable at proxy level (relevant to AS-001/AS-002).
- Agent-as-a-Proxy attack implications (EV-016) come from `docs/research/agent-as-a-proxy-attacks.md`. Monitoring-based defenses (including LLMTrace proxy monitoring) are fundamentally fragile: 90%+ ASR via GCG-optimized adversarial strings. Validates that structural defenses (AS-001/AS-002 sanitization, boundary tokens) are more robust than observation-based monitoring. High-perplexity detection in tool outputs is a viable countermeasure.
- IS-050 -> IS-052 dependency: IS-052 (adversarial string propagation blocking) depends on IS-050 (perplexity-based anomaly detection) for surprisal scoring. IS-050 must be implemented first. IS-052 runs before AS-002 in the tool-output sanitization pipeline.
- IS-050 -> IS-051 implicit dependency: IS-051 (adaptive monitoring scope) auto-switches to input-only mode when IS-050 detects sustained high-perplexity anomalies in tool outputs (suggests active adaptive attack). IS-050 must be implemented first for auto-switching; manual override works independently.
- ML-016 and EV-017 share GCG Python/PyTorch offline tooling (`tools/gcg/` or `scripts/adversarial/`). Not part of the Rust proxy runtime.
- EV-016 and EV-001 share AgentDojo benchmark infrastructure. EV-016 focuses on Slack suite (89 samples) with adaptive (GCG) attacks; EV-001 covers the full 97 environments.
- EV-018 depends on ML-006 (ensemble must be wired before transfer resistance can be tested).
- ML-016 (GCG adversarial sample generation) is in Loop 15 (Fusion Training Pipeline). Requires Python/PyTorch offline tooling, not Rust proxy code. Shared with EV-017.
- Token-level perplexity detection expectations (IS-050) come from `docs/research/token-level-perplexity-detection.md`. PGM-based per-token detection with GPT-2 124M (CPU-only, <1GB) achieves perfect sequence-level detection and 0.93+ token-level F1. O(n) DP algorithm. Core implementation reference for IS-050.
- Perplexity-based attack detection expectations (IS-050) come from `docs/research/perplexity-based-attack-detection.md`. Two-feature LightGBM (PPL + token length) achieves 99.1% F2 on GCG attacks. GCG mean PPL 3525 vs benign ~30-45. Perplexity alone is insufficient (false positives on code/non-English); token length as second feature resolves this.
- Task Shield alignment expectations (ML-016) come from `docs/research/task-shield-alignment-defense.md`. Task-alignment defense ("does this serve the user?") achieves 2.07% ASR with 69.79% utility on GPT-4o. ContributesTo scoring at message boundaries. Directly informs ML-016 goal-drift detector design; provides EV-016 baseline comparison targets.
- Spotlighting expectations (IS-004, AS-001/AS-002) come from `docs/research/spotlighting-indirect-injection-defense.md`. Datamarking reduces ASR from >50% to <3% with zero NLP quality impact. Dynamic/randomized tokens essential. Encoding (base64) achieves 0% ASR but requires GPT-4-class models. Validates and extends boundary tag approach.
- Instruction hierarchy expectations (IS-004, SA-003) come from `docs/research/instruction-hierarchy-defense.md`. Privilege hierarchy (system > user > tool) via SFT+RLHF. +63.1 pp on system message extraction defense. Validates proxy-level boundary tags as complement to model-level hierarchy. Over-refusal is main trade-off (-22.7 pp).
- DMPI-001–DMPI-006 (Loop 12a) were prerequisites for ML-001 (Loop 15). All 6 deviations are now resolved; the fusion classifier architecture matches the DMPI-PMHFE specification. See `docs/research/dmpi-pmhfe-prompt-injection-detection.md` for the authoritative paper breakdown.
- DMPI-003 and DMPI-005 resolved together: feature vector is now 10 binary dimensions matching paper Appendix A. See `docs/architecture/DMPI_003_TEN_BINARY_FEATURES.md`.
- DMPI-006 (naming) resolved: all 8 finding types renamed to paper's `is_*` convention.
- EV-002 is ✅ because the NotInject dataset is 339 samples with equal difficulty tiers (113/113/113).
